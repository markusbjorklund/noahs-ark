# Noahs-ark #
_**Noahs-ark** is the final project in our course Software Development tools. This CI pipeline exercise is done in our school Centria in Jakobstad, where we are the first students to be educated to junior developers in **Road to software engineering**. Our training started in January 2020 and will continue until December 2020. Due this pandemic covid-19 we're doing our school remotely this spring and hope we can meet in school again this fall._
_We have been five students working on this exercise. Our group is called **3#** and the members are: **Md Al Amin, Markus Bj√∂rklund, Anna Isokoski, Petrina Lindqvist and Janne Nylund**._
